# Hired.com-SquaresInBetween
Hired.com solution for Squares In Between Project

This is a project that was given to me by hired.com as a sample coding 
project. Given two numbers, output the number of square numbers between them
for example, if the input is [4, 17] output that there are 3 squares between 
them (inclusive), 2, 3 and 4 squared.
